<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DMS Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocular Camera</li><li>Multi-Eye Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>DMS Cameras, also known as Driver Monitoring System Cameras, come in two different market types: Monocular Cameras and Multi-Eye Cameras. A monocular camera is a type of DMS camera that uses a single lens to capture images and monitor the driver's behavior. On the other hand, a multi-eye camera utilizes multiple lenses to obtain a more comprehensive view of the driver and the surrounding environment. Both types serve the purpose of enhancing driver safety and alertness by detecting signs of drowsiness, distraction, or other risky behaviors.</p></p>
