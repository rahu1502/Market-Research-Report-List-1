<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Structural pervious pavement is a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for managing stormwater runoff. It includes three common market types: pervious concrete, porous asphalt, and interlocking concrete pavers. Pervious concrete is a mix of aggregate, cement, and water that allows water to pass through it, reducing runoff and replenishing groundwater. Porous asphalt is made with a specific blend of aggregates and binders, allowing water to infiltrate through the pavement and into the ground beneath. Interlocking concrete pavers are non-permeable, but their arrangement creates spaces between the pavers for water to percolate through, minimizing runoff.</p></p>
