<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electrosurgical Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The High Frequency Electrosurgical Equipment market includes two types of circuits: Monopolar Circuit and Bipolar Circuit. In a Monopolar Circuit, electrical current flows from an active electrode through the patient's body to a grounding pad, allowing for efficient cutting and coagulation during surgery. On the other hand, a Bipolar Circuit has both the active and return electrodes present in the instrument, which reduces the risk of unintended burns or tissue damage. These circuits are vital components of electrosurgical equipment, enabling precise and safe surgical procedures.</p></p>
