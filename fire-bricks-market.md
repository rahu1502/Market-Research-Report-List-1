<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unshaped (Monolithic Refractories)</li><li>Shaped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire bricks market consists of two main types: unshaped (monolithic refractories) and shaped. Unshaped fire bricks refer to refractory materials that are not pre-formed or shaped before installation and can be poured, rammed, or gunned into place. On the other hand, shaped fire bricks are pre-formed into specific shapes and sizes before being installed in various applications. Unshaped fire bricks provide flexible installation options, while shaped fire bricks offer convenience and ease of use due to their pre-formed nature.</p></p>
