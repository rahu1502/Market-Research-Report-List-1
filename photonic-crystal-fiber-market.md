<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic-crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photonic-crystal fiber (PCF) is a specialized type of optical fiber that uses a periodic arrangement of small air holes to control the transmission of light. There are two main types of PCF market: index-guiding fibers and photonic bandgap (air guiding) fibers. Index-guiding fibers rely on the difference in refractive index between the core and cladding to guide light, while photonic bandgap fibers utilize the concept of photonic bandgaps to confine light within a hollow core surrounded by a solid cladding. Both types offer unique advantages in terms of optical properties and applications.</p></p>
