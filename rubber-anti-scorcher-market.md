<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Anti Scorcher Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rubber anti-scorcher market can be divided into two main types: powder and granular. Powder anti-scorchers are finely ground substances that can easily be mixed with rubber compounds. They are preferred for their ease of handling, uniform dispersion, and quick incorporation into rubber formulations. Granular anti-scorchers, on the other hand, are larger-sized particles that are typically added to rubber compounds during the mixing process. They are known for their slower dispersion rate and provide a more gradual release of the anti-scorching agents, ensuring protection against scorching throughout the manufacturing process.</p></p>
