<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Column-Electric Power Steering Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Column-Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems utilize either a brushed motor or a brushless motor for their operation. A brushed motor employs carbon brushes and a commutator to provide the necessary electrical connection. It is simpler and less expensive, but requires maintenance to replace the brushes. On the other hand, a brushless motor uses an advanced technology that eliminates brushes, resulting in higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and longer life. Despite being more expensive, brushless motor systems are increasingly preferred due to their superior performance and reliability.</p></p>
