<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mainline Rail Signalling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Train Control</li><li>Communication Based Train Control</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mainline rail signalling systems market consists of two types: traditional train control and communication-based train control (CBTC). Traditional train control utilizes fixed block signalling and track circuits to monitor train locations and maintain safe distances. It is widely used but has limitations in capacity and reliability. CBTC, on the other hand, uses advanced communication technologies and continuous train control to enhance safety and increase capacity. It allows for real-time train tracking and precise control, resulting in improved efficiency and flexibility in rail operations.</p></p>
