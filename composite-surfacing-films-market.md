<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Surfacing Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Composite surfacing films are used in the manufacturing of composite materials to enhance the surface finish and durability of the final product. Autoclave processing involves subjecting the materials to high temperatures and pressure within an autoclave, resulting in a superior quality surface finish. On the other hand, out-of-autoclave processing eliminates the need for autoclave equipment and uses alternative methods such as vacuum bagging and oven curing. While both methods offer different advantages, they aim to achieve the same outcome of improved surface finish and structural integrity in composite materials.</p></p>
