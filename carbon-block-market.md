<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Block Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruded Type</li><li>Compressed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The carbon block market can be categorized into two types: extruded type and compressed type. The extruded type involves the manufacturing process where carbon material is forced through a die to form the desired shape. This type is known for its high density and mechanical strength. On the other hand, the compressed type involves the combination of carbon powder with a binder to form blocks under high pressure. This type is preferred for its ease of production and lower cost compared to the extruded type.</p></p>
