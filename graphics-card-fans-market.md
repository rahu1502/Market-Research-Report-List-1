<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphics Card Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the graphics card fans market, there are two main types of fans: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are typically found in open spaces and move air in a straight line parallel to the fan blades. On the other hand, centrifugal fans are more commonly used in constrained spaces and draw air into the hub and then force it outwards at a 90-degree angle. These types of fans serve different purposes depending on the graphics card's cooling needs and the available space inside the device.</p></p>
