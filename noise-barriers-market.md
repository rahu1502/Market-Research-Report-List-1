<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective type</li><li>Absorptive type</li><li>Mixed type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Noise barriers are structures designed to reduce or block the transmission of sound from a noisy source to a sensitive receptor. Reflective type barriers are made of solid materials that reflect sound waves back towards the noise source, preventing them from reaching the receptor. Absorptive type barriers are made of porous materials that absorb sound waves, reducing their strength. Mixed type barriers combine both reflective and absorptive materials to maximize noise reduction. These different market types cater to various noise pollution scenarios and offer different levels of effectiveness in reducing unwanted noise.</p></p>
