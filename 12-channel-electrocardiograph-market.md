<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 12 Channel Electrocardiograph Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resting ECG</li><li>Stress ECG</li><li>Holter ECG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 12 channel electrocardiograph market comprises three types: resting ECG, stress ECG, and Holter ECG. Resting ECG involves a non-invasive procedure that records the heart's electrical activity at rest, providing useful information in diagnosing heart conditions. Stress ECG is performed while the patient exercises on a treadmill or stationary bike, allowing for the evaluation of the heart's response to physical exertion. Holter ECG monitors the heart's activity continuously over a 24 to 48-hour period, providing valuable data for detecting irregularities that occur during daily activities.</p></p>
