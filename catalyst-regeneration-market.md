<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Catalyst Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-site Regeneration</li><li>On-site Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Catalyst regeneration refers to the process of restoring the activity of catalysts used in various chemical reactions. There are two main types of catalyst regeneration markets: off-site regeneration and on-site regeneration. Off-site regeneration involves sending spent catalysts to specialized facilities where they are regenerated and returned to the users. On the other hand, on-site regeneration is done at the user's location, eliminating the need for transportation. Both types aim to restore catalysts' functionality, allowing for cost-effective and sustainable use in industrial processes.</p></p>
