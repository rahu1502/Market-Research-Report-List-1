<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Acrylonitrile Content Type</li><li>General Acrylonitrile Content Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) Powder is available in two main market types: High Acrylonitrile Content Type and General Acrylonitrile Content Type. The High Acrylonitrile Content Type of NBR powder is characterized by a higher percentage of acrylonitrile monomer in its composition. This results in enhanced oil resistance, making it suitable for applications in automotive seals, gaskets, and oil field equipment. On the other hand, the General Acrylonitrile Content Type has a lower acrylonitrile content, providing improved flexibility and abrasion resistance, making it ideal for industrial hoses, conveyor belts, and seals.</p></p>
