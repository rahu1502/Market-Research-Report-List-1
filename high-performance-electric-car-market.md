<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Performance Electric Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-performance electric car market can be classified into two types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs are fully electric vehicles that rely solely on a battery for power, meaning they do not have an internal combustion engine. PHEVs, on the other hand, have both a battery pack and an internal combustion engine. While PHEVs can operate fully on electric power, they also have the flexibility to use gasoline or diesel fuel when needed, giving them a longer total driving range compared to BEVs.</p></p>
