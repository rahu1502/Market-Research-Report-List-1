<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airplane Fuel Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible Tank</li><li>Rigid Tank</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The airplane fuel tank market comprises two main types: flexible tanks and rigid tanks. Flexible tanks are made of durable and flexible materials, allowing them to expand and contract as fuel levels change. They are commonly used in smaller aircraft due to their lightweight nature. Rigid tanks, on the other hand, are made of rigid materials like metal or composite materials and do not have flexibility. They are often used in larger commercial aircraft, providing greater structural integrity and safety. Both types are essential components in storing and transporting fuel in airplanes.</p></p>
