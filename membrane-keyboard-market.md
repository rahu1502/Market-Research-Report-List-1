<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Keyboard Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat-panel Membrane Keyboard</li><li>Full-travel Membrane Keyboard</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane keyboards are categorized into two main types: flat-panel membrane keyboards and full-travel membrane keyboards. Flat-panel membrane keyboards have a flat surface with no tactile feedback, where a thin, flexible membrane layer is pressed to register a keystroke. They are commonly used in touch-sensitive devices like microwave ovens or calculators. On the other hand, full-travel membrane keyboards provide a tactile response similar to traditional mechanical keyboards. They utilize a flexible membrane layer, but beneath that layer, they have dome switches or metal springs to achieve a more tactile experience for the users.</p></p>
