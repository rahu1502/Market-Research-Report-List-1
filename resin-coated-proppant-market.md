<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resin Coated Proppant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Curable Resin-Coated Proppant</li><li>Precured Resin-Coated Proppant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The resin-coated proppant market consists of two main types: curable resin-coated proppant and precured resin-coated proppant. Curable resin-coated proppant refers to proppants that contain resins that require a curing process, usually through chemical reactions or heat application, to harden and create a strong bond between particles. On the other hand, precured resin-coated proppant is pre-prepared and does not require any additional curing process. Both types of resin-coated proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance the performance and longevity of fractures in oil and gas wells.</p></p>
