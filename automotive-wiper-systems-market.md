<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wiper Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Wiper</li><li>Boneless Wiper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive wiper systems market includes two main types of wiper systems: bone wipers and boneless wipers. Bone wipers, as the name suggests, have a metal arm or frame resembling a bone, which connects the wiper blade to the wiper motor. They are commonly used in older vehicles and offer a simple and cost-effective design. On the other hand, boneless wipers do not have a traditional frame and use a flexible metal strip to connect the blade to the motor. This design allows for improved windshield contact, higher efficiency, and reduced noise and vibration.</p></p>
