<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 5G Electromagnetic Wave Shielding Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal-mesh Film</li><li>Coating Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 5G electromagnetic wave shielding film market encompasses metal-mesh film and coating film types. Metal-mesh film consists of a thin layer with a grid-like structure, typically made of metal. This film is designed to shield against electromagnetic waves by reflecting or absorbing them. Coating film, on the other hand, involves applying a special coating onto a surface, such as glass or plastic, to create a protective barrier against electromagnetic waves. Both types of films serve the purpose of shielding against 5G electromagnetic waves but differ in their composition and application methods.</p></p>
