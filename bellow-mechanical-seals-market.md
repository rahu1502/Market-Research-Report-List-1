<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bellow Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bellow Mechanical Seals are categorized into two types - Pusher Type Seal and Non-Pusher Seal. </p><p>Pusher Type Seal has a dynamic secondary seal that pushes the face against the rotating shaft to maintain contact and prevent leakage. It is commonly used for high-pressure applications.</p><p>Non-Pusher Seal, on the other hand, does not require any dynamic secondary seal and relies on the elastic force of the bellow for face contact. This type is preferred in low-pressure applications where leakage prevention is essential.</p></p>
