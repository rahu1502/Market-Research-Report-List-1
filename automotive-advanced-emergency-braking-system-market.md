<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Advanced Emergency Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Initiative</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Advanced Emergency Braking System Market encompasses two types: Initiative and Passive. In the Initiative market, the system actively detects potential collisions and automatically applies the brakes to prevent or mitigate the impact. This type requires the driver to take minimal action and ensures a higher level of safety. On the other hand, the Passive market relies on the driver's reaction and intervention, providing alerts and warnings about potential collisions but relying on the driver to apply the brakes manually. This type may be less effective, as it relies on human response time and attention.</p></p>
