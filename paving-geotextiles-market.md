<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paving Geotextiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven Fibres</li><li>Non-woven Fibres</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Paving geotextiles market is divided into two main types: woven fibres and non-woven fibres. Woven fibres are made by interlacing individual strands of fibres in a pattern, creating a tightly woven fabric. This type of geotextile provides excellent strength and durability, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications such as road construction. On the other hand, non-woven fibres are made by bonding or felting synthetic fibres together. This type of geotextile offers high permeability and filtration capabilities, making it ideal for applications like pavement underlayments and erosion control. Both types contribute to enhancing the durability and performance of paved surfaces.</p></p>
