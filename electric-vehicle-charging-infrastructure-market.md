<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alternating Current (AC) Charger</li><li>Direct Current (DC) Charger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle charging infrastructure market consists of two main types: Alternating Current (AC) Charger and Direct Current (DC) Charger. AC chargers are commonly found in homes, offices, and public parking spaces. They convert AC power from the grid into DC power to charge the electric vehicle's battery. DC chargers, on the other hand, provide a much faster charging speed by directly converting high-voltage DC power from the grid to charge the vehicle's battery. DC chargers are typically found in fast-charging stations along highways and main roads.</p></p>
