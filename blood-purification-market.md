<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Purification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Blood Purification (CBP)</li><li>Hemodialysis(HD)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Continuous Blood Purification (CBP) is a type of blood purification technique that involves the continuous removal of waste products and toxins from the blood. It is commonly used in critically ill patients, as it provides a more gentle and efficient process by utilizing slow blood flow rates. Hemodialysis (HD), on the other hand, is a blood purification technique that involves the removal of waste products and excess fluid through an artificial kidney machine. It is mainly used for patients with end-stage renal disease. Other markets in blood purification include plasmapheresis and hemofiltration, which are used in specific cases such as plasma exchange or removal of excess fluid.</p></p>
