<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerant Oils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mineral Oils</li><li>Synthetic Oils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigerant oils are used in cooling systems to lubricate and protect the compressor. There are two types of refrigerant oils: mineral oils and synthetic oils. Mineral oils are derived from crude petroleum and provide good lubrication in standard cooling systems. Synthetic oils, on the other hand, are artificially produced and offer enhanced performance in high-temperature and high-pressure environments. Synthetic oils are more expensive than mineral oils but have better stability and lubricity, making them suitable for complex refrigeration systems.</p></p>
