<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isobutylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>≥99.7%</li><li>≥99.0%</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The isobutylene market can be divided into two main types based on the purity level of the compound. The first type is referred to as ≥99.7%, which means that the isobutylene being traded has a minimum purity level of 99.7%. This high level of purity is often required for applications that demand strict quality standards, such as in the production of high-performance rubbers or chemicals. The second type is ≥99.0%, which indicates a minimum purity level of 99.0%. This slightly lower purity is suitable for applications with less stringent requirements, such as fuel additives or solvents.</p></p>
