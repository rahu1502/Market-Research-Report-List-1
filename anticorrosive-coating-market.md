<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticorrosive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-borne Coating</li><li>Water-borne Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The anticorrosive coating market can be categorized into two main types: solvent-borne coating and water-borne coating. Solvent-borne coatings are formulated using organic solvents as a carrier for the coating material. These coatings offer excellent chemical resistance and durability but contain high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On the other hand, water-borne coatings are made with water as the main carrier, making them environmentally friendly with low VOC content. These coatings provide good adhesion, flexibility, and corrosion resistance, making them popular in various industries.</p></p>
