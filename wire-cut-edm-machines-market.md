<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wire-cut EDM Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wire-Cut Flushing Type EDM</li><li>Wire-Cut Submerge Type EDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wire-cut EDM machines are used in the manufacturing industry for precision cutting of materials. There are two main types of wire-cut EDM machines: wire-cut flushing type EDM and wire-cut submerge type EDM. Wire-cut flushing type EDM uses a high-pressure stream of dielectric fluid to flush away the molten material, allowing for faster cutting speeds. On the other hand, wire-cut submerge type EDM submerges the workpiece in a tank filled with dielectric fluid, offering better accuracy and surface finish. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements of the manufacturing process.</p></p>
